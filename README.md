# Simple Hand Shape(Palm) Recognition
Recognizing hand shape in simple environment
This code is based on [A GUI Support System for a Sight Handicapped Person By Using Hand Shape Recognition](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/976540) in 2002.
It is considered to recognized seven hand-shapes in image. The code is implemented in Matlab program.


### Preprocessing Image Steps

The proposed algorithm is shown in the following picture, which consists of three steps
